# file-encryption

The project is about file encryption using symmetric block ciphers. You can choose from 4 modes: ECB, CBC, CTR and OFB. The GUI allows the user to enrypt and decrypt any file. It has a functionality to compare the encryption file to the decrypted file to see if there are any differences.
